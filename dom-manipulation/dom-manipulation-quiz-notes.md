## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?

Represents a space-separated list of class names associated with the element.

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?

By using the className property.

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?

Represents the text content of an element and all its descendants.

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?

By using the textContent property.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?

No, if you already have an element reference stored in a variable, the event parameter can be excluded.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?

It would be harder because you can't test conditions and manipulate elements in the DOM.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?

The DOM won't store the number of clicks.
