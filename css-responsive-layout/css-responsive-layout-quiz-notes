## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

The points at which a media query is introduced.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

The element will resize correctly to the device it's being accessed on.  With fixed, you can have overflowing or non-uniform sizes.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?

Because the last media query takes precedence over the prior one.  It's the cascading order of the rules.
